I am a graduate student at Rice University, advised by Professor John Mellor-Crummey. Previously, I studied at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Professor Guangming Tan's PAA group. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student in Yunnan University, advised by Professor Wei Zhou.
